<h2>"NVM not NPM" ‚ùì</h2>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>What is an "NVM"?</h3>
<p>
NVM stands for Node Version Manager. Essentially, it is a system utility for installing, using, and managing multiple versions of Node.js.
</p>
<p>
Below is a NVM-Windows example when using a Bash (Git Bash, more specifically) shell:
</p>

<p>
$ nvm list<br><br>
  
    15.8.0<br>
  * 14.15.5 (Currently using 64-bit executable)<br><br>

$ node -v<br>
v14.15.5<br><br>

$ nvm use 15.8.0<br>
Now using node v15.8.0 (64-bit)<br><br>

$ node -v<br>
v15.8.0<br><br>

$

</p>

<p>
As you can see above, we're able to switch versions of node with a simple nvm use command.
</p>


<h3>Why an NVM?</h3>
<p> you work on multiple Node.js projects at any point, simultaneously or sequentially, it would behoove you not to have more than one version of Node.js on your machine ‚Äî especially if you maintain any number of legacy and modern applications at an enterprise.</p>

<p>
Let's put this in perspective: at the time of writing this sub-section of Angularization (February 15, 2021), Node.js was initially released 11+ years ago (May 27, 2009) ‚Äî soon to be 12 years ago. Since that time, there's been 500+ versions released for Node.js.</p>

<p>
Therefore, invest some time into researching and using a reliable type of NVM, since at some point ‚Äî if not now or in the past ‚Äî you'll most likely need it as Node.js development progresses.
</p>

<p>
I'll be using NVM-Windows, but you can check the "NVM Alternatives" sub-section for other popular NVM projects.
</p>

<h3>How to Install NVM</h3>
<p>
As mentioned in the previous sub-section, I and another developer used NVM-Windows for our Node version manager during our initial Angular 11+ session, and I have been using it since Summer 2016 (if I remember correctly).</p>

<p>
Needless to say, I haven't had any troubles with it on a Windows machine.
</p>

<p>

Follow the set of instructions in the "Installation & Upgrades" sections in the README found here on GitHub.
</p>
<p>

WARNING: Make sure you read the PREREQUISITE part for uninstalling existing Node.js & NPM installations.
</p>
<p>

Also be sure to read the second paragraph about global module conflicts and backing up any global npmrc configurations.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
Done? Okay... now ‚Äî time to put nvm to use.
</p>

<h3>How to Use NVM</h3>
<p>
NVMs' commands vary due to different implementations so check your preferred NVM's documentation for details.
</p>
<p>


For NVM-Windows, refer to the https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#usage page and section full description of all the commands.
