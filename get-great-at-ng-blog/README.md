The following are instructions for how to use this example Angularization app.
<br>
<br>

## System Requirements
<br>

Before you clone this repository, I recommend that you have the [latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (`14.16.0` for me at the time of writing this) since that is the version I used to create this Angular application.


```bash
$ node -v
v14.16.0
```

<br>

If you're completely new to Node.js you can look into my ["<em>NVM</em> not NPM" article here](https://github.com/pjnalls/Angularization#nvm-not-npm--1) and return back to this guide.

<br>

## Getting Started

<br>

`git clone` this Angularization repository `cd` into the downloaded folder.

```bash
# This is a Git Bash example.

$ git clone https://github.com/pjnalls/Angularization.git

$ cd Angularization

~/Angularization (main) $
```
<br>

Then move the folder to your desired location and `cd` into that project in that location.

```bash
$ mv ./get-great-at-ng-blog ../path/to/example/app/location

$ cd ../path/to/example/app/location/get-great-at-ng-blog
```
<br>

If you don't have `yarn` installed, simply run the following `npm` command:

```
$ npm --global install yarn
```
<br>

Now install `npm` and `yarn` dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install

...

$ yarn install

...
```
<br>

Lastly, run the Storybook server locally with the `storybook` script:

```bash
$ npm run storybook

...
```
...

<br>
And... enjoy ðŸ˜€!
